    "# PLAICraft Planning Report\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The following proposal is based on the data provided by the PLAI, a research group based in the Computer Science department at the University of British Columbia. Their main research revolves around building and developing generative AI that is reliable and safe. In their current research they aim to build an embodied AI. This particular AI has the capacity to interact in complex environments and respond to speech. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the embodied AI, PLAI has created a mock minecraft world (called “PLAICraft”) to collect behavioural data of players then use it to train and enhance their AI model. In order to concentrate their recruitment effort, the PLAI research group has posed the question of which “kinds” of player are most likely to contribute large amounts of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report I will be analysing the provided data from PLAI to understand the various demographics of player and draw a conclusion from such. \n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the visualised observations made above, I propose the use of a regression model to predict which players are most dedicated to the game. Unlike the calssification model, the regression model was made specifically to predict numerical values. Using the various categories each player falls under and predicting such with the use of their playing times can effectively indicate which players are more likely to spend time on the game and ultimately allow the researchers to decide who to expend their recruiting efforts towards. Additionally, With the use of KNN Regression it is necessary that we make the assumption that points that are closer together on the graph are more likely to have similar values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this method is more logical (and useful) than KNN Classification there are still a few issues that may arise with its use. As seen on the graphs above there is a fairly large disparity in particular player’s gender, age, and subscription status. These imbalances could possibly affect the performance of the model, and should be taken into consideration when reading the prediction values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to have a point of comparison, I will use the information given by the bar graphs to reference whether the predictions made by the classification model are congruent with the scatterplot observations, as well as using the statistical summaries to note cohesion in data patterns. The observations from the bar graphs and scatterplots will also provide information as to which values should be chosen to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "To garner my results I will be using the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the data into training, testing, and validation data \n",
    "2. Split the training data in to smaller sets (5 total)\n",
    "3. Cross validate the outcomes (tune the K value to gain multiple accuracy outcomes)\n",
    "4. Use the testing data to make a prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "To further evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the classifier I will also use the confusion matrix on the testing data to analyze its performance. \n",
